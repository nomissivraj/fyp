# Voice Developer
Voice Developer is my final year project for my BSc University Degree.

# Prerequisits
  - Windows PC
  - SoX Sound eXchange : https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/
  - Internet Connection
  - Microphone
  - A mouse with 3 standard buttons; left click, right click & mousewheel click - These operate the different voice command modes in the text editor. 

This application currently only supports Windows and requires that SoX is installed on the machine with the Environment PATH set up and a stable internet connection.
