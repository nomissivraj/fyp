# Voice Developer
Voice Developer is my final year project for my BSc University Degree.

# Prerequisits
  - Windows PC
  - SoX Sound eXchange : https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/
  - Internet Connection
  - Microphone
  - A mouse with 3 standard buttons; left click, right click & mousewheel click - These operate the different voice command modes in the text editor. 

This application currently only supports Windows and requires that SoX is installed on the machine with the Environment PATH set up and a stable internet connection.

# SoX
To set up SoX:
  - Download and install from here https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/
  - Find install location of SoX: usually C:\Program Files (x86)\sox-xx-x-x (current version is sox-14-4-2) copy the location address and have this ready.
  - Go to My Computer / This PC → Properties → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables → System variables. Or simply search environment variable
  - Select Path in the top panel of the window
  - Click 'Edit' then 'New' and paste your install address 
  - Finally click 'OK' until Environment Variable & System Properties windows are closed.
If you had the Voice Developer application open during this process, please restart it, or close it before starting.
